Image Change Detection System

VisionDelta is a Python-based image processing tool that automatically detects changes between before and after images. It highlights the changed regions using bounding boxes and exports the annotated results as new images.

This project is useful for:

Surveillance

Traffic monitoring

Construction progress tracking

Remote sensing

Scene comparison

Industrial inspection
